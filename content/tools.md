# Tools that we use

## Control Systems

The Unit Operations laboratory at RHIT features three DeltaV distributed control systems, provided through an Education Agreement with Emerson. We use these as Test, Development, and Production systems.

The unit currently feature over 400 tags and try to feature many different industrial protocols, inlcuding: HART, Wireless HART, Profibus DP, Profibus PA, Modbus TCP, EtherNet/IP, DeviceNet, OPC DA, and OPC UA.

## Analytics and Data Science

Our cloud historian stack is based on:
* Custom developed OPC UA plugin for Telegraf
* InfluxDB for time series data storage
* Grafana for visualization and dashboarding

In Process Analytics, we teach students to process this data using Python through Jupyter notebooks. For plotting we use Plotly.

## Network Infrastructure
Students in our lab get the chance to learn networking and server design. We have projects in:
* Setting up firewalls
* Creating VLANs and ACLs
* Server virualization
* Emerging network standards such as Ethernet-TSN
