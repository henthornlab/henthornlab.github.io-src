## Chocolate Research

A few years back I decided to supplement my *Intro to Design* and *Fluid Mechanics* courses with the rheological behavior of chocolate. This launched a research "hobby" that has been a rewarding subject and collaborative area. 

Since then, I have given talks about the *Science and Engineering of Chocolate* to a multitude of groups, ranging from grade school students up to adults enrolled in a life-long learning course. We have performed in-person chocolate tastings and, when COVID hit, even conducted virtual chocolate tasting events. 

## A few pictures from the various events:
